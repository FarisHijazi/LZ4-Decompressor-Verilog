# LZ4-Decompressor-Verilog
This project is about designing and implementing LZ4 decompression algorithm in hardware using Verilog hardware description language.  
For full details, see the [report](LZ4%20Decompression%20final%20report.pdf).

This is part of a university course project [COE405 Design And Modeling Of Digital Systems](http://www.kfupm.edu.sa/departments/coe/Pages/en/COE-405-Design-And-Modeling.aspx) at [KFUPM](http://www.kfupm.edu.sa/Default.aspx) with [Dr Aimane](http://faculty.kfupm.edu.sa/COE/aiman).

## Report thesis

The report discusses the how the project was executed and how we designed the control unit and datapath.  
The report also includes tests and [simulations](https://github.com/FarisHijazi/LZ4-Decompressor-Verilog/tree/master/Simulations) to decompress data compressed.

Below is the schematic of the datapath.
